# Data

There are three csv-files from which the program extracts essential data to generate a weekschedule.
- In ```studenten_en_vakken.csv``` there is data regarding the individual course registration per student with their student number, first name and last name. 
- ```vakken.csv``` contains the data regarding the number of courses to be scheduled. For each course you can see how many lectures, tutorials or labs need to be scheduled. It also states how many students are registered and the maximum capacity of the tutorials and labs.

- In ```zalen.csv``` you can find the data about the available halls per time slot per day. Each room has an individual capacity.

There is a txt-file named ```abbreviations.txt``` that contains the abbreviations of the courses. The abbreviations are used to make a weekly schedule more clear.
